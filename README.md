# Image Tamper Detector

**NOTICE**
This project is a functional image analysis system that combines multiple detection techniques. While the core functionality is operational, some detection parameters are still being optimized for improved accuracy. The system is suitable for experimental use and research purposes.

## Overview
A sophisticated image tampering detection system that combines multiple analysis techniques to identify potentially manipulated regions in digital images. The project implements several proven analysis methods and provides a practical platform for image authenticity verification.

The system successfully employs Error Level Analysis (ELA), Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU), Entropy Analysis, and computer vision techniques to detect areas that may have been digitally altered or generated.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 (Python 3.13 is not yet supported by TensorFlow as of April 2025)
- pip (latest version recommended)
- Node.js 18+ (for frontend)
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-tamper-detector.git
cd image-tamper-detector
```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.12:
```bash
python --version  # Should output Python 3.12.x
```
If needed, install Python 3.12 using pyenv or your preferred version manager.

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode (Recommended)

The project includes a convenient shell script that starts both frontend and backend in development mode with hot-reload enabled:

```bash
# From the root directory
./scripts/start.sh
```

This will:
- Start the backend server on port 8000 with auto-reload
- Start the frontend dev server on port 5173 with hot module replacement
- Watch for changes in both frontend and backend code
- Output logs from both services in a single terminal

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`
- API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

#### Running Services Separately

If you need to run the services separately:

1. Start the backend server:
```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

2. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

#### Using Docker

1. Build and run using Docker Compose:
```bash
# Build and start both frontend and backend
docker-compose up --build

# Run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop the containers
docker-compose down
```

The application will be available at the same ports as in development mode.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests/
```

For specific test modules:
```bash
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_ela.py    # Test ELA module
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_prnu.py   # Test PRNU module
python -m pytest backend/tests/test_entropy.py # Test Entropy module
```

### API Endpoints

## Technical Details

### Error Level Analysis (ELA)

The system uses Error Level Analysis to detect image tampering by:
1. Recompressing the image at a known quality level
2. Computing the difference between the original and recompressed versions
3. Analyzing error levels to identify inconsistencies that may indicate tampering

### Photo Response Non-Uniformity (PRNU)

PRNU analysis detects image tampering by:
1. Extracting camera sensor noise patterns from images
2. Computing normalized cross-correlation between patterns
3. Generating correlation heatmaps to identify:
   - Regions with inconsistent noise patterns (potential tampering)
   - AI-generated content (lacking proper sensor patterns)
   - Images from different source cameras

### Entropy-based AI Detection

The system uses entropy analysis to detect AI-generated content by:
1. Computing local entropy patterns across color channels
2. Analyzing cross-channel entropy consistency
3. Identifying artificial patterns characteristic of AI generation:
   - Natural images: Higher matching proportions (>35%)
   - AI-generated images: Lower matching proportions (<35%)
4. Generating visualizations of suspicious regions

### Thresholds

- ELA thresholds:
  - Untampered: 15.0% (maximum acceptable difference for original images)
  - Tampered: 5.0% (minimum difference to flag potential tampering)
- PRNU thresholds:
  - Same camera: > 0.5 correlation
  - Different cameras: < 0.5 correlation
  - Tampered regions: Local correlation variations
- Entropy thresholds:
  - Natural images: > 35% matching entropy patterns
  - AI-generated: < 35% matching entropy patterns
  - Local uniformity: > 20% for pattern detection

## Known Limitations

1. **False Positives**: The current implementation may incorrectly flag legitimate images as tampered or AI-generated
2. **Threshold Sensitivity**: Detection thresholds are not yet optimized for real-world use
3. **AI Detection Accuracy**: The entropy-based AI detection system needs further refinement
4. **Performance Optimization**: Some analysis operations may be slower than necessary
5. **Limited Testing**: While test cases exist, more comprehensive testing with diverse image sets is needed

## Development Goals

1. Optimize detection thresholds through machine learning
2. Reduce false positive rate
3. Improve processing speed
4. Enhance AI-generated content detection accuracy
5. Complete frontend visualization components
6. Add comprehensive error handling
